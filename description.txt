This mod offers you leveling systems for you game.
Those leveling systems can be used just for fun, or to increase the challenge and gameplay time of your game.

Multiplayer isn't functional right now and there's only one game mode active, which is N Terraria's Regular RPG Mode, with a number of tweaks.

If you have issues with the mod, also make a post on the discussions thread, so it's easier to debug, and keep track of the issue.

If mana cap is kicking your behind, use this mod alongside it to remove the cap:
