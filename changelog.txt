Free Mode
- Fixed issue where monsters health were being multiplied twice.
- Added some script to avoid monsters stats from overflowing.
- Player health should now be calculated correctly.
- Defense gain per level should now matter.
- Experience percentages and exp gain percentages should now be displayed correctly based on your character rank.
-> Exp value actually will still use the level value, instead of 10 levels value.
- Level Up! text will now only be shown after you passed 10 levels, instead of 1.
Regular RPG Mode
- Tweaked how health and mana increase work for player character. Will also avoid overflow.
Mod
- Added "LevelChangeFactor" to game mode settings.
-> Setting it to a value under 1, will let the mod know that a division of levels equals 1 level gain.
-> For example, on Free Mode, that value is set to 0.1, which means each 10 levels gain means you gain 1 level up.
