# NExperience 1.4
This is the tModLoader 1.4 version of NExperience mod.<br><br>
NExperience is a mod that adds leveling system to your Terraria, with the possibility of having different game modes, and options to customize your experience.<br>
You can find the mod through the Mod Browser, or the Steam Workshop page:<br>

<br><br>
The reason why I'm rewriting the mod, is to try easing support to other mods.
<br><br>
If you want to add support to this mod, or add content to it, check its wiki here on Github.<br>
